# HangmanSolver

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a set of heuristics or strategies that an computer player could use to play games of Hangman. I will also be evaluating and testing heuristics with the Collins Scrabble Words (2019) dictionary to determine which strategies give the best of changing minimizing the number of guesses required to correctly guess the secret word.

### Letter Frequency

Letter frequency is the perhaps the most basic strategy for choosing a letter. The idea being that, you choose the letter that most frequenlty occurs in the set of possible words.
This was the first heuristic implemented and is currently being evaluated by testing every word in the Collins Scrabble Words (2019) dictionary.
